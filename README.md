### Java 14 examples
* This project contains some examples of features that are either ***preview*** or ***standard*** in Java 14 (comments to indicate the status are in the classes.)
    * A helpful article on enabling preview in IntelliJ (the article is relevant to 13 but that guidance applies to 14) https://www.baeldung.com/java-preview-features
* To run the examples, run either `gradlew run` or `./gradlew run` 
    * Verify the name of the class to run in the `mainClassName` attribute (`build.gradle` file)
